      <h6>THE PROBLEM</h6>
      <h2>How might we reduce the risk of delivering tainted food to food pantries?</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       Every week, the food bank receives 8-12 recall notices from multiple sources like FDA, USDA, MDARD, and Feeding America. With tons of food donated from all kinds of sources, the organization developed a work-around by manually selecting recall notices and notify food sorting volunteers about only the highly likely notnated items with printed poster copies. This process is unreliable and could risk serving tained food to food pantries.
       <br><br>For the semester project, our team was tasked to help the organization find an easily implementable solution that ensures food safety.

      <h6>THE PROCESS</h6>
      <h2>Using qualitative research methodologies to find the root causes</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
      <h5>Background research</h5>
       <p>In order to aquire comprehensive understanding of our client and their problem, we first worked separately to research on one aspect of the problem. I was in charge of a competitive analysis with other food banks in the state of Michigan, comparing and constrating all seven food banks in Michigan in terms of their background, resources, services, food management practices, and recall handling strategies.
       <br><br>
       </p>
       <h5>Contextual inquiry</h5>
       <p>In pairs of two, we conducted six hour-long, in-depth interviews using the contextual inquiry method to understand the details of the organization's current donated food handling process. By observing our interviewees do the tasks and taking photos to collect contextual data, we were able to understand the reasons behind many decisions that led to the current procedure.
       <br><br>
       </p>
       <h5>Affinity diagramming</h5>
       <p>During the interpretation session, we played back the audio recording and noted down one issue roughly every minute. In the end, we collected approximately 270 notes for all 6 interviews. To synthesize research data, I suggested an efficiently to build an affinity wall to learn the most crutial issues of the problems.
       <br><br>
       </p>
       <img class = "project-wide-img" src = "imgs/foodbank/wall.gif" alt = "affinity wall process"/>
       <div class = "full-section-text align-center">
         <h6 class = "text-darkgrey">I suggested each team member work on affinity notes in the approximity of them first, and gradually merge similarly themed notes together to build clusters and meta-clusters.</h6>
       </div>
       <p>
       <br><br>
       In the end, we built a wall of four layers with five meta-clusters: current recall handling limitations, partner training and communication, volunteer management and sorting, warehouse inventory management, and data management.
       <br><br>
       <img class = "project-wide-img" src = "imgs/foodbank/findings.png" alt = "key findings"/>
       </p>
       <h5>Solution brainstorming</h5>
       <p>Based on the resarch findings, each of us came up with several possible solutions, and used a self-designed rubric with weighted factors to evaluate each ideas.
       <br><br>
       </p>

      <h6>THE SOLUTION</h6>
      <h2>Low-tech yet immediately effective actions</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
      The final solution features a series of strategies that can be implemented immediately to raise the awareness of tainted food handling procedure, both within the organization and throughout the distribution channel, as well as achieving more careful inspection quality.

      <ol class = "lists">
      <li>Implement regular drills to address system weaknesses and improve response times.</li>
      <li>Maintain a well-documented and salient information display by means of donor inventory list, flyer for storage racks, and adjusted flyer placement.</li>
      <li>Increase notification awareness with keyword detection,increased mailing frequency, and automatic poster generation procedure.</li>
      <li>Add a new volunteer position dedicating to recalled food handling.</li>
