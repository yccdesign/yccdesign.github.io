      <h2>Contributed to a highly performant, empowered product team</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       In late 2020, I worked in a product team to build the first version of an end-to-end experience of creating and modifying a fundamental data component on the ServiceNow platform. For this project, my design challenge was to consolidate the building flow from 15 disparate pages to a one-stop shop.
       <br><br>
      </p>

       <img class = "project-wide-img" src = "imgs/sn/different_tools.png" alt = "different tools for building forms on the platform"/>
       <div class = "full-section-text-wrapped align-center">
         <h6 class = "text-darkgrey">The project aimed to consolidate the form building process from different tools on the platform</h6>
       </div>
       <p>
       The team started with a few challenges. Since the team was formed by members coming from a different product, everyone had to learn about the data component together in order to build a builder for it. In addition, there had not been much usability research for existing building experiences around the component, so most of the data collection had to start from scratch. What's more, the team was also given a short development time frame while dealing with technical constraints.

       <br><br>
       In order to work efficiently to build a quality V1 product as the only product designer, I helped facilitate an empowered product team. I did the following:
       <br>
      </p>
      <h5><br>1. Be involved, and involve everyone early in the process</h5>
       <p>
       <br>
        Since the start of the development process, I had been very involved in the team by attending technical discussions with the PM and engineers to facilitate design explorations. I also invited the researcher and content designer to recurring team meetings although they were not fully dedicated to the project. This has helped to embed everyone in the team, bridge the information gap, and has made collboaration more seamless.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <h5><br>2. Embrace different perspectives</h5>
       <p>
       <br>
        As the only product designer in the team, I had been proactive when it comes to communication and feedback elicitation. This was done through co-working sessions, guerilla testing, and workshops with not only the users but also our team members. Many features and enhancements originated from an engineer, the researcher, or the content designer's idea, or even multiple of them together from co-working sessions.
        <br><br>
        By creating an environment where everyone can contribute to the design, I was able to get more data points and iterate more rapidly.
      </p>
      <h5><br>3. Collaborate with researcher to test rapidly and effectively</h5>
       <p>
       <br>
        In a rapidly developing team, we tested frequently and rapidly too. Aside from quick, informal feedback chats and regular design reviews within the design organization, the team has strived to test regularly. By co-planning testing sessions with the researcher and running research in parallel with the design and development proccess, we were able to test not only the initial design ideas but also the revisited topics, in order to achieve a better product outcome.
        <br><br>
        During the testing, I invited everyone in the team to participate in the sessions, where we used a separate discussion thread to take notes. This not only reduced the time for team alignment and communication, but also helped achieve a better product outcome.

      <h6 class = "text-blue">WHAT I LEARNED</h6>
      <h2>One team, one dream</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        With the product team sharing the same goal to create a great product, we were able to navigate ambiguities together. Rapid iteration won't be possible without such embedded team culture.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, I've learned that cross-functional collaboration and deep engagement was the key to better design outcomes. By investigating the technical details with the PM and engineer, participating research sessions, and hosting multiple co-working sessions, I was able to know about the product inside out, and articulate each design decision confidently.
