      <h2>Creating a WYSIWYG building experience for ServiceNow forms</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       Form is a fundamental UI component usable across all ServiceNow apps to display and edit record data. However, the end-to-end experience of building and editing a form required using 15 disparate tools, many of which using obsolete tech stack and were unintuitive to users to configure. This led to a confusing and inconsistent experience that impedes app building efficiency in App Engine Studio.<br><br>
       In late 2020, I joined a product team tasked to build a new editing experience for creating and modifying ServiceNow forms.

      <h2>It's more than a form building experience</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Through our preliminary research, we learned that the form-building experience not only entails forms but also the correlated table component. We've also identified a list of common configurations that are commonly edited outside of the existing form-building tools. This led us to rescope the project to cover the end-to-end building experience of a form component.

      <h2>How might we streamline the table and form building experiences?</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Table Builder is an existing tool in App Engine Studio that allows citizen developers to construct data table structures and create fields that will be displayed in form views. Launching another tool just for building forms may lead to disconnected building experiences for users while missing the opportunity to strengthen the connection between a table and its form. Therefore, we tested the concept to consolidate table and form building experience, which was well received and set the direction for further iterations.

      <p>
         <br>
        This decision has led to various collaboration and alignment work with related product teams. For example, I revisited the creation flow of the table component and proposed a redesign to reinforce the connection between the table and form components in multiple touchpoints. Table editing has also incorporated configuration experiences made available for forms to achieve a consistent experience. Working with the App Engine Studio team, we've also redesigned the representations of forms in the app inventory to match the tooling enhancements.

        <h2>Unified experience consolidated from 15+ disparate tools</h2>
        <p>
          <br>
          The final deliverable for the project was an embedded experience of form building within Table Builder, shipped along with various configuration capabilities that would otherwise be done in multiple different browser tabs outside of the App Engine Studio, such as UI Policy, dependent choices, and table inheritance settings. The configured form views can be directly applied in low-code apps within the same studio, resulting in a much more consistent and streamlined workflow.

      <h2>Navigate ambiguities in an empowered product team</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Cross-functional collaboration and deep engagement was the key to better design outcomes. By investigating the technical details with the PM and engineer, participating in and moderating research sessions, and hosting multiple co-working sessions with the researcher and content designer, I was able to establish a sense of ownership in each team member to drive better outcomes as an embedded team. I also got to know about the product inside out through the process, which helped me to articulate each design decision confidently.
