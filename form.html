      <h2>Creating a WYSIWYG building experience for ServiceNow forms</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       Form is a fundamental UI component utilized across all ServiceNow apps to display and edit record data stored on the ServiceNow cloud platform.
       <br><br>
       Despite being a foundational component, the end-to-end experience of building and editing a form required using 15 disparate tools, many of which were still using obsolete tech stack and were unintuitive to use. This led to a combersome experience that impedes app building efficiency in App Engine Studio.
       <br><br>
       In late 2020, I joined a product team tasked to build a new editing experience for creating and modifying ServiceNow forms.

      <h2>It's more than a form building experience</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Through our preliminary research by analyzing common user flows, we've realized the original scope might not be viable.
        <br><br>First of all, our users frequently modifies the data stored in table while building a form. Secondly, we've also identified a list of configurations that are commonly edited together with building a form. These configurations are located in multiple disparate tools external to the App Engine Studio.
        <br><br>These discoveries led us to rescope the project to provide a seamless end-to-end form building experience.

      <h6 class = "text-blue">DESIGN & ITERATION</h6>
      <h2>How might we streamline the table and form building experiences?</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        App Engine Studio treated a table as a separate component from a form. Since we learned that both components are in fact frequently edited together, it's imperative to provide a more seamless building experience. But how might we do so?
        <br><br> Luckily, the App Engine Studio does have a proprietary table builder. To avoid reinventing the wheel, I proposed merging our to-be-developed product with the table builder into one single buliding experience for the best experience outcome. Through concept testings, we validated the product direction and had the confidence to solicit it with our stakeholders.

      </div>
    <div class = "full-section-text">
      <p>
         <br>
        The merging has led to various collaboration and alignment initiatives with related product teams.
        <br><br>For example, I revisited the creation flow of the table component and proposed a redesign to reinforce the connection between the table and form components in multiple touchpoints. Table editing has also incorporated configuration experiences made available for forms to achieve a consistent experience. Working with the App Engine Studio team, we've also redesigned the representations of forms in the app inventory to match the tooling enhancements.

        <h2>Unified experience consolidated from multiple disparate tools</h2>
        <p>
          <br>
          The final deliverable for the project was an embedded experience of form building within Table Builder, shipped along with various configuration features that would have otherwise been aceessed in different tools outside of the App Engine Studio, such as UI Policy, dependent choices, and table inheritance settings. The configured form views can be directly applied in low-code apps within the same studio, resulting in a much more consistent and streamlined workflow.

      <h2>Navigate ambiguities in an empowered product team</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Cross-functional collaboration and deep engagement was the key to better design outcomes. By investigating the technical details with the PM and engineer, participating in and moderating research sessions, and hosting multiple co-working sessions with the researcher and content designer, I was able to establish a sense of ownership in each team member to drive better outcomes as an embedded team. I also got to know about the product inside out through the process, which helped me to articulate each design decision confidently.
