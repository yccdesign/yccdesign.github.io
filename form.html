      <h2>Creating a WYSIWYG building experience for ServiceNow forms</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       A form is a fundamental UI component used across all ServiceNow apps allowing users to interact with data stored on the ServiceNow cloud platform.
       <br><br>
       Despite being a foundational component, the end-to-end experience of building and configuring a form required using 15 disparate tools, many of which were still using obsolete tech stack and were unintuitive to use. This has led to a combersome experience that impedes app building efficiency in App Engine Studio, a low-code app building tool to reduce time-to-market of custom ServiceNow apps.
       <br><br>
       In late 2020, I joined a product team tasked to build a new editing experience for creating and modifying ServiceNow forms.

      <h6 class = "text-blue">RESCOPING THROUGH RESEARCH</h6>
      <h2>It's more than a form building experience</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Our team's first task was to understand the problem space through our own preliminary research. Through cross-functional efforts involving analysis and interviews, we realized that the original scope might not be viable.
        <br><br>
        From our end-to-end analysis, we learned that the form component works hand-in-hand with another component: the table. Each form field originates from a table definition, so admins and app builders often modify table data while building a form UI.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, we identified a list of configurations that are commonly edited while building a form. These configurations are located in multiple disparate tools external to the App Engine Studio. While the original request was to modernize the form UI with a more streamlined WYSIWYG editor, the lack of feature parity with the aforementioned common configurations could result in low user adoption.
        <br><br>
        These discoveries led us to rescope the project to provide a seamless end-to-end form building experience.

      <h2>How might we streamline the table and form building experiences?</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        App Engine Studio treated a data table as separate building block from a form. Since we learned that both components are in fact frequently edited together, it's imperative to provide a more seamless building experience. But how might we do so?
        <br><br> 
        The App Engine Studio does have a proprietary Table Builder. To avoid reinventing the wheel, I proposed merging our to-be-developed product with Table Builder into one single buliding experience for the best experience outcome. Through concept testings, we validated the product direction and had the confidence to solicit it with our stakeholders.
      </p>

        <h6 class = "text-darkgrey">Early and later stages of explroations to integrate form-building within the existing Table Builder tool in App Engine Studio, where features to edit data table, form, and other logic have been consolidated into a single platform, with more configuration options in addition to the original layout feature added based on user feedback </h6>
      </div>
    <div class = "full-section-text">
      <p>
         <br>
        The direction to integrate the form-building process into Table Builder functionality has led to various collaboration and alignment initiatives with related product teams.
        <br><br>
        For one, I revisited the creation flow of the table component. Through my expeirence audit, I realized that if our creation flows were to kept the same within App Engine Studio, app builders may not easily connect the dots between table and form. Instead, we need to inform users about the existence of a form view whenever a data table is created, as well as how a form cannot standlone separate from any data table. Based on these findings, I held a few workshops and proposed a redesign to reinforce the connection between the table and form components in multiple touchpoints. 
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
      <br><br>
       For another, my design has influenced the Table Builder team to create an aligned experience on their end in the following releases. For exmaple, editing more detailed properties were previously unavailalbe when defining a table field. With them being available on form-editing side, we've enabled Table Builder with the same functionality.

        <h2>Unified experience consolidated from multiple disparate tools</h2>
        <p>
          <br>
          The final deliverable for the project was an embedded experience of form-building within Table Builder, shipped along with various configuration features that would have otherwise been aceessed in different tools outside of the App Engine Studio, such as UI Policy, dependent choices, and table inheritance settings. The configured form views can be directly applied in low-code apps within the same studio, resulting in a much more consistent and streamlined workflow.

      <h2>Navigate ambiguities in an empowered product team</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Cross-functional collaboration and deep engagement was the key to better design outcomes. By investigating the technical details with the PM and engineer and hosting multiple co-working sessions with the researcher and content designer, I was able to establish a sense of ownership in each team member to drive better outcomes as an embedded team. 
        <br><br>
        I also learned from this zero-to-launch builder project when to align with existing product experiences, and when to break from existing patterns to provide the most suitable design for my use case.
