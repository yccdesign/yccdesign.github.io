      <h6>BACKGROUND</h6>
      <h2>What is LineLeap and its services?</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       LineLeap is a student-founded startup that provides a marketplace for bars and nightclubs. On the consumer-facing mobile app, users can purchase and redeem fast passes, drink deals, and more to enjoy a great night out.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>
       LineLeap also works with venue owners to help grow the local nighlife businesses in more than 20 cities. Curently, a few leadership responsible for growth, sales, and marketing manage all venue-facing logistics on a self-built Content Management System (CMS). This includes sending out sales report, creating new products and adding inventory, as well as providing customer support.

      <h6>IDENTIFIED CHALLENGES FROM RESEARCH</h6>
      <h2>How might we leverage LineLeap's CMS to grow the revenue and scale of the nightlife marketplace?</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       After a few weeks of UX research including user interviews, heuristics evaluation, and stakeholder meetings, three major challenges have emerged that determined the project scope.
       <br><br>

      <h6>SOLUTION OVERVIEW</h6>
      <h2>From a self-managing admin system to a venue owner-facing business management platform.</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Over the semester, I tranformed LineLeap's CMS from an internal administration system to a business-oriented platform that offers analytical data insights and inventory management services to LineLeap's participating venues. <br><br>
        The new design also provides more streamlined experience for LineLeap teams to deal with day-to-day business and content administration.

      <h5>1. Brand new business analytics dashboard</h5>

      <h6>ACTION PLAN</h6>
      <h2>Scoping the design project</h2>
      <p>
        Working closely with the ZLI program manager and the product manager of LineLeap, we evaluated observed issues and examined the business goals of the startup to flesh out an action plan for the CMS. Three goals in the order of priority are as follows:<br><br></p>
        <ol class = "lists">
        <li>Redesigning the venue management experience</li>
        <li>A brand-new business analytics dashboard feature</li>
        <li>Increase ease of mangement of scaling services</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <p>In the following paragraphs, I will focus on the redesign process of the venue management experience, which includes two main features: <b>pass creation process</b> and <b>inventory overview</b>.

      <h6>FEATURE 1</h6>
      <h2>Pass creation, redesigned.</h2>
      <p>
        As the most complained feature for current users, the original pass creation process consisted of two separate tasks: creating a pass and adding inventory, each required four main steps to complete.

         After putting the version into test with 5 users, which included current users and non-users, we found that current users gave very positive feedback on the changes. However, the design was still very confusing for non-users:<br><br>
         <b>Feedback 1: </b>Preorder and daily pass types are not easily understandable for non-users.</b><br>
         <b>Solution idea: </b>Examine pass type differences and redesign the information presentation..</b><br><br>

      <h6>FEATURE 2</h6>
      <h2>Inventory overview</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>The original system did not provide a clear overview on product inventory. Results of user interviews have indicated an urgent need to easily browse real-time inventory status and change pricing or stock more swiftly.</p><br><br>

      <div class = "full-section-text align-center">
        <h6 class = "text-darkgrey">The original inventory information was nested in each pass accordion, making it difficult to see what passes are sold for each day.</h6>
      </div>
      <p>Current user pain points and prospective user needs all suggested a redesign of the inventory status presentation so that the sales status is easily accessible and actionable.</p><br><br>

       <h6 class = "text-darkgrey align-center">User needs for the inventory status design collected from interviews.</h6>
      <br><br>
      <p>After analysing other system's inventory design, I chose to adopt a calendar view that would allow for better information browsability and business decision making.</p><br><br>

        <h5>Version 1.</h5>
        <p>
         The first version features a split view that includes a smaller calendar and a daily information panel. It allows users to easily check pass sales status on each day.

        </div>
        <p>Overall, users were surpised to see a calendar view and they loved it. However, some isseus were observed throughout the tests.<br><br>
          <b>Feedback 1: </b>Users wanted to see more information.</b><br>
          <b>Solution idea: </b>Experiment having a single calendar view with more data provded on the overview.</b><br><br>
          <b>Feedback 2: </b>One user pointed out that most of the time the pass inventory is set to be unlimited. A bar that shows remaining pass may not display immediately discernable information.</b><br>
          <b>Solution idea: </b>Redesign the inventory bar with more pass information.</b><br><br>

          The second and final version was developed based on the user testing results. Key features include: <br><br>

        <ol class = "lists">
          <li>Single calendar view with daily inventory information shown on click.</li>

      <h6>CONCLUSION</h6>
      <h2>Accomplishments, lesson learned, and reflections</h2>
      <p>Within a few months, I have redesigned the whole CMS platform for LineLeap. The digital transformation can help the business scale in the fiture, while immediately reducing current efforts of the growing Lineleap team. The design is currently put into production stage and I look forward to see the design making a positive impact for a startup.<br><br>
      I have gain a lot of communication and strategic product thinking skills working on this project as well by working extremely closely with the product manager. Being able to delve deep into a marketplace backend product also allowed me to think critically when designing a scalable complex system.<br><br>
      If I had more time, I would love to test the final version with more venue owners to evaluate the design. Also, I would love to explore some great ideas collected from user testings that were not put into design under time constraints, such as a notification feature for upcoming big events and marketing campaign suggestions.
