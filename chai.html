       Working from home is lonely and can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle. It shouldn’t be.
       <br>

       CHAI is a real-time communication system that provides audio connection between you and your team, as if you were working in the same office. The seamless collaboration allow users to stay easily connected and avoid the need to impose on teammates with calendar invites and texts. </p>

        Our team adopted a rapid product development approach, which involved researching the problem space, scoping and re-scoping, as well as ideating and iterating evolving design concepts.

      <h6>DEFINE & DEVELOP</h6>
      <h2>Dealing with fuzziness: Moving back-and-forth between ideation and rescoping stages</h2>
      <p>
        From the research findings, we started to brainstorm a number of potential product concepts and crafted low-fidelity prototypes for each concept. In order to converge different ideas to one product concept focus, we conducted a concept test with 34 participants to forcaste potential market share, as well as an internal anonymous questionnaire among all teammates to evaluate which concept we would like to focus on.

      <p><br><br>
        From the results, we discovered a discrepency between the team's preferences and the results of the concetp test. After reviewing our methodology, we realized that most of our recruited participants were current students, and thus may have led to biased results. We collected more feedback from interviewing experienced remote workers and data from table research. <br><br>
        To our surprise, all remote workers we interviewed really like the idea of 'cubicle buddies'. This helped us validate the user needs for this concept and decide to focus on this product idea for the greatest team success.<br><br>

      <h6>IDEATE & MAKE</h6>
      <h2><del>How might we help single working adults establish healthy habits?</del><br>How might we help remote workers feel less socially isolated at work?</h2>
      <p>
        After the research phase, we re-scoped our project to focus on improving the wellbeing of remote workers. Based on our research, the major pain point that remote workers have is social isolation, which may also lead to unstructured lifestyle and chronic loneliness. Throughout a 30-minute brainstorming session, the team reached to a consensus to develop a communication system that helps remove the isolation experienced by remote workers by connecting them together, as if they are working at the same cubicle.

      <h5>Physical device design iterations</h5>
      <p><br>
        In order to determine the look and feel of the physical product, we conducted another concept test with 30 participants to understand user preference on the product design style. Initially, the options ranged from playful to professional, and from non-anthropomorphized to anthropomorphized. We then narrow down to 9 key design concepts to test with. The results showed that 'natural', 'animal', and 'interactive' are the most popular styles. Our product designer iterated the design based on the 'natural' style.

To engage the whole team with the design process, I hosted a participatory design workshop, where we discussed major features for the software system and brainstormed possible interface design.
