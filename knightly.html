      <h2>A mobile app that helps you enjoy a better night out.</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       Have you ever waited in the cold to get into a popular bar on a football night? What if you can skip the line and join the party sooner, instead of shivering in the bad weather?<br><br>
       Nightly Knight is a mobile app that enables users to purchase fast passes to skip the line, pre-order food and beverages, while marking their favorite night venues and exploring new ones to ensure another fun night out.

        Imagine you are designing a mobile application for customers to interact with their favorite bars. The app should allow users to select a bar, purchase a pass to get into the bar without waiting in line, and preorder drinks and food at the bar.

      <h6>DEFINING EXPERIENCE OUTCOMES</h6>
      <h2>Understanding user needs and design goals</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        I conducted a quick research session by collecting online reviews of similar platforms to understand user pain points and use cases.
        <br><br>
      </p>
        <img class = "project-wide-img middle" alt= "laying" src = "imgs/knightly/research.png"/>
       <br><br>
       <p>
        From there, I developed a set of experience outcomes that the mobile application should achieve:

      <h6>IDEATION & PROTOTYPE</h6>
      <h2>Top-down approach focusing on the usage scenarios</h2>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
      <p>
        After gathering user needs, I mapped out the strucutre of the app.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <img class = "project-wide-img middle" alt= "IA" src = "imgs/knightly/ia.png"/>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Color Palette</h5>
      <p>I opted for a dark theme design for the app's visual, because the app is most likely being used at night, where the abient light is low. The color palette features blue and violet to create an electric vibe that signifies nightly fun. </p>
      <br><br>
      <img class = "project-wide-img middle" alt= "IA" src = "imgs/knightly/color.png"/>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Scenarios and usage flow</h5>
      <p>I developed two major usage scenarios synthesized from the research phase. For each, I created a user flow to validate my desgin.
      <br><br>
      <b>Scenario 1. Joining the partying group</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote class = "text-darkgrey">
        When Jenny arrives at La Loca after her part-time job and sees the long line, she is afraid that she has to join Juana’s birthday party even later.<br><br>
        She opens the app and learns that the Club will be closed at 1am. That is just almost three more hours away. As she thinks about how many epic moments she is going to miss while standing in the line, she quickly purchases La Loca’s fast pass. From the top preorder menu list she also picks her favorite cocktail, to get herself a quick start.<br><br>
        Walking straight through the door and getting her drink at the bar after displaying her purchase confirmation, she saw her friends at the other side of the room.

      <br><br>
      <b>Scenario 2. Planning for the awaited night</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote class = "text-darkgrey">
        When Bohi and friends finish the tough midterm week, they knows it’s time to celebrate. Nothing will be more fun than drinking beer while watching Michigan plays at OSU this Saturday evening.<br><br>
        As the usual leader in the group, he has to make sure nothing ruins their night. Knowing that their favorite bar, Ace’s, will be all full at a game night, Bohi opens the app to purchase fast passes for 5 of them. He can’t be more delighted to see that the first beer only costs 75 cents when pre-ordered with each pass. <br><br>
        When the group shows up at the bar, Bohi opens the app and enjoys his friends’ appreciation as they walk pass the waiting line.

      <h6>REFLECTIONS</h6>
      <h2>If I had more time...</h2>
      <p>This design challenge is a great learning experience for me to explore a different industry and design the user experience for it. In addition, I have learned to make design decisions based on speculations on user behaviors, comparative analysis, and previous design experiences, instead of direct user feedback. Compared with other projects that I have done before, this exercise has allowed me to think more critically while making quick decisions.<br><br>
      If I had more time, I would have done more primary research by talking to nightlife experts such as frequent party goers and venue owners, in order to learn more pain points and usage scenarios. Especially, I am interested in learning user search behaviors while waiting in line, and any nuances related to the night time and the fun-having purposes that this app offers. I would also have loved to design the interface for the businesses to help them visualize business performance and customer management.<br><br></p>
