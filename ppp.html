      <h2>How might we help code enforcement officers leverage Dynamo Metrics' data power for their daily inspection work?</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       As a data-visualization and consulting company, Dynamo Metrics has been in the making of a tailor-made data visualization application for the code enforcement team at the City of Jackson. With little UX resources, the company was in need of deeper understanding of user needs and a mid-fidelity prototype that helps code enforcement officers better access their urban data.

      <h6>UX RESEARCH</h6>
      <h2>Getting the domain knowledge and understanding users</h2>
      <p>
         My teammates and I took several steps to learn about everything that entails the users.
       <br><br>
      </p>
      <h5>Background Research</h5>
      <p>We conducted a throrough background research by researching the client's past projects, inspecting current software interface, as well as reading governmental webpages and documents to understand the Code Enforcement Department's various code ordinances they are responsible for.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <img class = "project-wide-img middle" alt= "research" src = "imgs/ppp/bgresearch.png"/>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Heuristic Evaluation</h5>
      <p>I analyzed the current layering and filtering features on the platform, from which I identified three major interaction issues:
      </p>
      <ul class = "lists">
      <li><b>Missing Legend:</b> The missing lengend on map requires users to rely on working memory to infer what data each color represents. </li>
      <li><b>Excessive Visual Element:</b> Current UI utilizes a long with a total of 8 accordians with 3 radius buttons and 42 checkboxes. A minimalist design could help users navigate more easily.</li>
      <li><b>Lack of system status display:</b> CThe layer feature does not display layering order of the data. Additionally, the playback interface also lacks clear affordance for starting and ending points in time. Users may feel confused while navigating on the platform.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class = "full-section-text align-center">
        <h6 class = "text-darkgrey">The original UI of the platform.</h6>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
      <p>We then proceeded with competitive analysis with five code enforcement management applications and one data visuazliation web solution, where we observed two major differences:      </p>
        <ul class = "lists">
        <li><b>Data types:</b> Some competitors provide summative data or index. Our client's current application would improve by adding predictive and summative data for users to quickly learn the status of an area. </li>
        <li><b>Interaction elements:</b> Our clients' curernt design incorporates multiple accordions and checkboxes, which took a lot of space on the screen. On the other hand, two competitors utilized floating blocks or hidden features to dedicate more real estate for the map.</li>
        </ul>

        <img class = "project-wide-img middle" alt= "old ui" src = "imgs/ppp/competitive.jpeg"/>

      <h5>Field Observations & In-Depth Interviews</h5>
      <p>We conducted four interviews were conducted at the City of Jackson with the head of the code enforcement team, two code enforcement officers, as well as the code enforcement administrator. A PDF sample of the interview protocol can be found <a href="imgs/ppp/protocol.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
      <br><br>
      We synthesized interview data into an affinity wall and a set of personas.
